### About integrate with yaml-cpp

Due to my incapability of creating a nicely premake file and subsequent build flow...
I just manually do it...

First get yaml-cpp from github

Build it. (follow its instruction...)

Copy its .dll from both release and debug to the include bin folder I specified...

Copy all its files inside its include folder, to the include folder I specified...


Then luckily, it works now...

Now, I'll just carry with dll files with my whole project...

(it requires different dll files for debug and release configuration, I've set them in my premake file now.)
