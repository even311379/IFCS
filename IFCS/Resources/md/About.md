# IFCS - Integrated Fish Counting System

A tool set that include all necessary steps to establish an automatic fish counting system in fish way. It aims to make ecological researchers to easily establish their own object detection pipeline for their target species. It it designed for fish way, but should work perfectly in any similar use case. The core algorithm for object detection in this app is [yolo v7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7). 

### Major features:
* Annotate on both image and directly on video clip
* Asset management system surrounding with yolo v7 models to help you train your best model to use.

Hope this will make your life easier.
